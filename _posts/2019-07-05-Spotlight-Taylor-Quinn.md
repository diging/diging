Earlier this year, Taylor Quinn joined DigInG as a full-time Software Engineer after being a student worker for the past 1.5 years. We are excited to have him on board and it’s time for a short introduction!

Before joining DigInG, I was a Geographical Information Science Student in the School of Geography at ASU. My main interests as a student were the applications of Remote Sensing in the analysis of climate change and the impacts of possible solutions. During that time, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to intern with the NASA DEVELOP Program where I worked on a research project in conjunction with the City of Tempe to analyze the effects of using vegetation to combat the Urban Heat Island effect within the City of Tempe.

During my time as a student worker with DigInG, I was able to hone in on my Python and web programming skills while learning how to build infrastructure for computational research. My current interests are making research tools that are approachable and easy to use while still having the capabilities to tackle complex problems, maintaining and utilizing large datasets especially text and image-based data, the applications of remote sensing, the processing of satellite imagery, and teaching Python and web development for research. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, hockey, Formula 1, and playing guitar.
