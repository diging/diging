Looking back: <a href= "http://localhost:4000/2019/05/02/rse2017.html" target= "_blank">“Intro to Python”</a>
 
On May 8-9, 2019, we’ve hosted our first “Intro to Python”-workshop. On the first day, Taylor Quinn talked about the basics of programming with Python such as variables, loops, functions, and how to use Jupyter Notebooks to run Python code. On the second day, we spent some time learning about what Git is, and how to use GitHub to manage code. We then talked about wrangling Data in Python using Pandas. Two of our three participants made it all the way to the end, and we are very proud of them!
